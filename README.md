## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PWA Angular Standalone Signals (Storage) App with Themes.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning PWA, Capacitor, Kubernetes, Vue.js and try to slowly dive into Spring, as a frame of the current project API.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Years ago, I've started my career as a BE Dev, working on an PHP Laravel project and in fact - it was a pleasure!
