## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PWA Angular Standalone Signal state App with Themes.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning PWA, Capacitor, Kubernetes, Vue.js and try to dive slowly into Spring, as a frame of the current project API.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Years ago, I've started my career working on an PHP Laravel project.
